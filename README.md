Experimenting with mruby
========================

I think mruby is great. However, I can't say that about the documentation of the project. The best way to find out how things work is to experiment with them, here I just try to share my experiments with the world so other people can draw upon that experience and speed up their understanding of the language.

Feel free to use, copy or share anything in this repository.
